# Covid19DataAPI
This API was developed as a part of project www.covidsimpact.com . 
The data for this API is sourced from Worldometers real time updates.
The dataFileAPI.txt in the repo consists of covid-19 global stats data in JSON format which is parsed as JSON in the node application.
This .txt file is updated every ten minutes by running a python script for scraping data on the live server.

# Note
The python script which is used for scraping this data and generating the .txt file is not included in this repo and this repo is uploaded only to demonstrate the working technicality of the node application which is serving the data to the consumer.
